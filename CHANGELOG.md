# Changelog

## Unreleased — context diagnostics

- Added `proof` with human-readable and JSON output, exact UTF-8 byte and Unicode
  code-point counts, loaded-entry classifications, category totals, and separate
  accounting for available context not loaded.
- Resolver output retains diagnostic fields with or without instruction contents.
  Repository/host context is explicitly outside managed instruction-body totals;
  token counts are marked not calculated. No additional runtime dependencies.
- Updated the README around installation, configuration, presets, and proof.

## Unreleased — presets

- Added local `preset inspect`, `preset import`, and `preset export` workflows
  with a versioned data-only manifest, role selection, bundled/local skills,
  explicit conflict choices, opt-in defaults, and editable provenance records.
- Added in-memory validation of proposed instruction files, source/target stale
  checks, and shared rollback for preset application.
- Added a small release-review preset and documentation. No remote sources,
  executable hooks, automatic updates, or conditional role/profile routing.

## 0.1.0 — Unreleased

- Deterministic exact-model, family, and fallback profile resolution, independent
  of role selection; local YAML configuration with validated references.
- Required skill loading and available skill metadata with on-demand loading,
  including explicit repository-local source mappings.
- Claude Code and Codex bootstrap integrations with preserved instruction files,
  idempotent initialization, validation, and managed-block removal.
- Interactive role creation, editing, and deletion with paginated, filterable
  skill selection, explicit duplicate-source aliases, and preview before save.
- Minimal profiles, roles, skills, portable bootstrap, and contributor guides.
- Guarded file writes with stale-edit detection and rollback on reported failures.
- Package-artifact workflow checks and CI for Windows, macOS, and Linux on
  Node.js 22 and 24; development type and lint checks without a build step.

No remote instruction fetching, telemetry, model execution, or orchestration.
